# VEHICLE INSURANCE FRAUD DETECTION USING MACHINE LEARNING WITH VARIOUS IMBALANCED DATASET HANDLING METHODS

Predicting vehicle fraud insurance claims is difficult as the datasets used to train the 
machine learning model are imbalanced. The imbalance vehicle insurance fraud dataset 
contains more legitimate claims compared to fraud claim data. It is difficult for machine 
learning models to have good performance to predict the fraud claim as the trained model 
with an imbalanced dataset will be biased toward the majority class. The different 
imbalanced datasets can be suitable for different handling techniques

This is the research project has been carried out for three objectives which are:

1. To identify the methods for handling imbalanced datasets to improve the 
performance of the vehicle fraud detection model.
2. To identify the best resampling ratio of the dataset to get the optimized 
performance of each trained model.
3. To evaluate the performance of methods used in handling imbalanced datasets for 
each machine learning model.

At the end of this research,
